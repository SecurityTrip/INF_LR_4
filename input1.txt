Near the eastern shore of the Hudson, at the broad part of the Hudson river, there lies a small market-town called Greensburg, but which is more generally known by the name of Tarry Town.
Not far from this town, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley among high hills. 
This is one of the quietest places in the whole world. 
A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to rest, and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in the complete calmness.
